From there it was expanded into an identity system for a made up company. Arctic Qiviut is a company that sells qiviut fiber, yarn, and products. Qiviut comes from the undercoat of musk ox, and is similar in quality to cashmere.</p><p><b>Texture from raw qiviut fiber can be added to the logo to give it further meaning and visual interest.</b></p>"
