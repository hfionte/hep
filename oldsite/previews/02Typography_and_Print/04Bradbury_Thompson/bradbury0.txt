It is sometimes a serious and useful tool, employed to deliver a message, or give life to an idea. At other times it is a plaything that affords personal amusement and recreation. An interest in Type provides a broader knowledge of history, including the appreciation of such related arts as painting, architecture and literature - and even business and politics. In short, Type can be a tool, a toy and a teacher; it can provide a means of livelihood, a hobby for relaxation, an intellectual stimulant, and a spiritual satisfaction. An interest in Type necessarily includes a zest for everyday life.</i><br/>- Bradbury Thompson</p>"
