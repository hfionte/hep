  	<div class="content">
  	<p>It is during the 1990s that the Hum phenomenon began to be reported in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America">North America</a> and to be known to the American public, when a study by the University of New Mexico and the complaints from many citizens living near the town of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taos%2C_New_Mexico">Taos, New Mexico</a>, caught the attention of the media. However, in the 1970s and 1980's, a similar phenomenon had been the object of complaints from citizens, of media reports and of studies, mostly in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> but also in other countries such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand">New Zealand</a>. It is difficult to tell if the Hum reported in those earlier cases and the Hum that began to be increasingly reported in North America in the 1990s should be considered identical or of different natures. During the last decade, the Hum phenomenon has been reported in many other cities and regions in North America and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe">Europe</a> and in some other regions of the world.</p>
	
	<p>Although the cases of Taos and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokomo%2C_Indiana">Kokomo, Indiana</a>, have received the most publicity in the United States, this could be a consequence of the local citizens being more active in regrouping and having their voice heard by the media, not necessarily a consequence of the Hum being more present there. Probably because only a small percentage of the population is directly affected by the Hum, there has been no large scale study about the Hum yet, but only local initiatives with very limited financial resources. For this reason, those studies have focused primarily on only a small number of possible causes that are more easily investigated with those limited resources, and have generally ended with the conclusion that more research was necessary but that would require resources more important than those available at the local level.</p>
