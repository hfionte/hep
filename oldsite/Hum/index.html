  	<p><span class="B">The Hum</span> is a generic name for a series of phenomena involving a persistent and invasive low-frequency <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hum">humming</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise">noise</a> not audible to all people. Hums have been reported in various geographical locations. In some cases a source has been located. A well known case was reported in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taos%2C_New_Mexico">Taos, New Mexico</a>, and thus <span class="B">The Hum</span> is sometimes called the <span class="B">Taos Hum</span>: the unsolved nature of the hum in Taos has become part of the appeal of Taos. Hums have been reported all over the world, especially in Europe. The Hum is most often described as sounding somewhat like a distant idling <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_engine">diesel engine</a>. Typically "The Hum" is difficult to detect with microphones, and its source and nature is a mystery to the listener.</p>
	<p>The "Hum" is sometimes prefixed with the name of a locality where the problem has been particularly publicized: e.g., the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol">Bristol</a> Hum" or the "Taos".</p>
