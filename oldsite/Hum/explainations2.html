  	<h2>Some possible explainations</h2>
  	</div>
  	<div class="content">
  	<p>Some explanations of hums, for which no definitive source has been found, have been put forth. These include:</p>

	<h3>Man-made noises</h3>

	<p>High frequency attenuation of distant industrial sounds or stereo <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subwoofer">subwoofers</a> from homes, cars, and music venues. As sound moves through the atmosphere or ground, the high frequencies decrease in amplitude more rapidly than the low frequency ones, which subsequently travel greater distances. The low-frequency sounds can be amplified by walls and structural geometry, and sound like ambiguous rumblings or hums. Industrial machinery such as compressors, pumps and fans can also produce similar types of sounds. Although this is one of the explanations that first come to mind, ordinary microphones have failed to detect the Hum and investigations have failed to convincingly trace the Hum to such sources. Studies in the UK have addressed this issue, and the report about the Kokomo Hum offers examples of sources of acoustic noise.</p>

	<h3>Infrasound made by geological events</h3>

	<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrasound">Infrasound</a> from different possible sources, possibly of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic">geologic</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonic">plate tectonic</a> nature.</p>

	<h3>Pulsed microwaves</h3>

	<p>A phenomenon similar to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_auditory_effect">microwave auditory effect</a> from pulsed microwave sources, possibly in combination with other factors. The thermoelastic mechanism may or may not be involved. Various types of electromagnetic sources could involve different physical or physiological mechanisms or a combination thereof. Some of the components of the electromagnetic environment, and examples of their possible combined effects, have been discussed in the annex to the report about the Hum by the experts hired by the city of Kokomo, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana">Indiana</a>.</p>

	<h3>Electromagnetic caused by meteors</h3>

	<p>A variant of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_frequency">audio frequency</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic">electromagnetic</a> emissions generated upon the entry of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteor">meteor</a> and its disintegration in the upper atmosphere. The disintegration of larger meteors in the upper atmosphere is known to release <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megawatt">megawatts</a> of power in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_frequency">audio frequency</a> range, primarily through the interaction of the resulting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization_trail">ionization trail</a> with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field">Earth's magnetic field</a>. See, for example <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2001/ast26nov_1.htm">Listening to Leonids</a> for a description of the meteor audio effect. (It is also speculated that the "solar wind" may be causing a similar effect to the "meteor audio effect.")</p>

	<h3>Extremely Low Frequency communications systems</h3>

	<p>Communication systems, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_with_submarines">submarine communications systems</a> that use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremely_low_frequency">extremely low frequency</a> (ELF) radio transmissions. Proponents of this theory suggest the transmissions may somehow produce effects either directly or indirectly through mechanisms similar or different of those by which higher frequencies are detected.</p>

	<h3>Ionospheric heating systems</h3>

	<p>Large-scale effects of one or several of the ionospheric heating projects in Norway, the U.S. or Russia, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAARP">HAARP</a> in Gakona, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska">Alaska</a>.</p>

	<h3>Tinnitus</h3>

	<p>Generated by the body, the auditory or the nervous system, with no external stimulus. Somewhat like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinnitus">tinnitus</a>, but at lower frequencies. However, this theory fails to explain why the Hum can only be heard at certain geographical locations, or indoors as opposed to outdoors. There exists no such thing as an "indoor tinnitus". On the other hand, there may exist individual differences as to the threshold of perception of acoustic or non-acoustic stimuli, or other normal individual variations that could contribute to the fact that some people in the population perceive the Hum and others do not.</p>

	<p>While hypothesized to be a form of low frequency tinnitus such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_hum">venous</a> hum, some sufferers claim it is not internal being worse inside their homes than outside. However, others insist that it is equally bad indoors and outdoors. More mystery is added as some only notice the hum at home, while others hear it everywhere they go. Some reports indicate that it is made worse by attempted soundproofing (e.g., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_glazing">double glazing</a>), which only serves to decrease other environmental noise, thus making the Hum more apparent.</p>

	<h3>The tensor tympani muscle making the eardrum tremble</h3>

	<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_of_2005">As of 2005</a>, a scientific hypothesis suggests the Hum originates on the eardrums of affected individuals by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_tympani">tensor tympani</a> muscle trembling. (The tensor tympani is a muscle within the inner ear for tightening the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eardrum">eardrum</a>.) The 40-page hypothesis can be read in German on the pages of the German Association for Research about the Hum, IGZAB (InteressenGemeinschaft Zur Aufklärung des Brummtonphänomens). See: <a href="http://www.igzab.de/">http://www.IGZAB.de</a> . See <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brummton_Ph%C3%A4nomen">de:Brummton Phänomen</a>.</p>

	<p>Any combination of two or more of the above types of explanations.</p>
