  	<p>The essential element that defines the Hum is what is perceived as a persistent low-frequency sound, often described as being comparable to that of a distant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_engine">diesel engine</a> idling, or to some similar low-pitched sound, and for which no identifiable cause is found after the ordinary possibilities (e.g., household appliances, traffic noise, etc.) have been eliminated.</p>

	<p>Other elements seem to be significantly associated with the Hum, being reported by an important proportion of Hum sufferers, but not by all of them. Many people hear the Hum only, or much more, inside buildings as compared with outdoors. Many Hum sufferers can also perceive vibrations that can be felt through the body. Earplugs are reported as not decreasing the Hum. The Hum is often perceived more intensely during the night.</p>

	<p>Some people perceive the Hum continuously, but others perceive it only during certain periods. For some people, the perceived Hum can represent a faint sound and a mild annoyance, while for others who perceive the Hum's sound and/or vibrations more intensely it represents a nuisance that can seriously interfere with daily activities. Common consequences include a lack of sleep, as the Hum can keep some sufferers awake or wake them in the middle of the night.</p>
